# Job Market Paper
[Learning from Past Prices: Evidence from the UK Housing Market](https://risteskasimona.github.io/files/papers/LearningHousing.pdf)

Imperfect knowledge about the structure of information flows can cause pricing mistakes in environments characterised by social learning. Using a natural experiment from the UK housing market that generates shocks to the information set of prospective sellers, along with data on housing prices and property listings, I show that sellers do not account for duplication of information that arises in settings where prices are determined sequentially and each seller observes the actions of previous actors. Stale information gets overweighted with each repeated use and this can lead to small shocks having a long-lasting effect on aggregate market dynamics when fundamentals are highly persistent.

[Revealed Expectations and Learning Biases: Evidence from the Mutual Fund Industry](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3301279)

(with [Francesco Nicolai](https://francesconicolai.github.io)) 

By inverting the optimal portfolios of mutual fund managers in a fairly general setting, which allows us to partial out the effect of risk aversion and hedging demands, we provide an estimate of perceived expected excess returns and show that they are significantly affected by experienced returns. The effect of past returns is non-monotone: we provide reduced-form and structural evidence of managers displaying recency and primacy bias. Finally, we estimate an average coefficient of relative risk aversion close to unity.

[Living on the Edge: the Salience of Property Taxes in the UK Housing Market](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3381519)

Taxes that happen concurrently with the purchase are more salient than deferred taxes. Using a sharp geographical discontinuity between London Boroughs, we show that the incidence of property taxes deferred to the future is too small compared to the incidence of stamp duty taxes happening at the moment of buying the property. The difference in incidence implies very large discount rates that cannot be easily rationalized even after accounting for liquidity constraints. The lack of salience at the moment of purchase implies that the burden of the tax will be borne in the future to meet the budget constraint. This implies that there is an optimal tax mix, even though one of the two taxes is more distortionary than the other.
